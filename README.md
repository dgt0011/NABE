# NABE

Not Another Blog Engine (NABE) is not another blog engine.

It is in fact an ocpp server intending to support ocpp 2.0.1

This is a placeholder project for the time being to timestamp when the idea occured to me for the NABE.

Last month I was having a conversation with the Enterprise Architect.  Part of that conversation was the following;

- [EA] Why do we not have <redacted/>
- [Me] Well, that would mean we would <redacted/>
- [EA] Do you not think that represents <redacted/>
- [Me] well, yes, but <redacted/>

Obviously an internal conversation to the org so I can't give the full context of the conversation.  HOWEVER whilst doing some mundane tasks today whilst musing on this conversation and considering my need to build *something* public - why not kill two proverbial birds with the one rock?

Hence the idea for the NABE ocpp server was born.
